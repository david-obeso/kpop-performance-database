My OneDrive Client Setup on Linux (using abraunegg/onedrive)
1. What I've Done (The Setup Process):
Installed the Client: I've installed the onedrive client for Linux, specifically the one developed by abraunegg (from GitHub: https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive). This is a powerful and well-maintained command-line client.
Initial Authorization: I have run onedrive once without arguments (or with --resync for the very first time) and followed a link to authorize the application with my Microsoft account, then pasted the response URI back into the terminal.
Configured the Client:
I created the main configuration file: /home/david/.config/onedrive/config
In this file, I've set:
sync_dir = "/home/david/Documents": This tells the client that my local OneDrive folder (where files will be downloaded to and uploaded from) is /home/david/Documents.
monitor_interval = "300": This means if I use the --monitor mode, the client will check for changes every 300 seconds (5 minutes).
I created a selective sync file: /home/david/.config/onedrive/sync_list
In this file, I've listed KpopDatabase_2.1.xlsm. This tells the client:
Only download/sync this specific file (and any folders needed to reach it if it's nested on OneDrive).
If other files/folders exist in /home/david/Documents directory that were previously synced from OneDrive but are not in sync_list, they will be deleted locally during a resync or normal sync to make the local directory match the sync_list criteria. They remain on OneDrive.
Performed an Initial Resynchronization: I just successfully ran /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --resync. This was crucial because:
It told the client to discard any old ideas it had about your synced files.
It forced it to re-read the config and sync_list.
It then scanned my entire OneDrive online, compared it to my sync_list, and built a fresh local "map" of what needs to be synced, downloading KpopDatabase_2.1.xlsm into /home/david/Documents.
2. How to Sync the Files (Common Commands):
Remember to run these commands from the terminal. You can be in any directory when you run them, as the client knows where your sync_dir is from the config.
A. One-Time Sync (For the moment I will NOT use this option):
Command: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync
What it does:
Checks for changes on OneDrive (for files in your sync_list).
Downloads any new or updated files from OneDrive to /home/david/Documents.
Checks for local changes in /home/david/Documents (for files in your sync_list).
Uploads any new or updated local files to OneDrive.
Deletes local files if they were removed from OneDrive (and were in sync_list).
Deletes remote files if they were deleted locally (and were in sync_list) unless you configure sync_dir_permissions or other flags to prevent this. (Default is two-way sync).
B. One-Time Sync (Download-Only)(THIS IS MY PREFERRED OPTION):
Command: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --download-only
What it does:
Checks for changes on OneDrive (for files in my sync_list).
Downloads any new or updated files from OneDrive to /home/david/Documents.
It will NOT upload any local changes I've made. This is useful because I only want to fetch from the cloud.
C. Continuous Sync (Monitor Mode - "Set it and Forget it"):
Command: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --monitor
What it does:
The client starts and performs an initial sync (like --sync).
It then runs in the background (or foreground, keeping your terminal busy unless you background it with & and nohup).
Every monitor_interval seconds (300 seconds / 5 minutes for you), it automatically checks for changes and syncs them (both downloads and uploads, according to your sync_list).
To stop it: If it's running in the foreground, press Ctrl+C in the terminal. If you backgrounded it, you'd need to find its process ID (ps aux | grep onedrive) and use kill <PID>.
3. Important Reminders & Troubleshooting:
sync_list is Key: Since I am using sync_list, only the items in that file will be present in my /home/david/Documents directory after a sync. If you want to sync more items, add them to the sync_list file (one item per line). If you want to sync everything, delete or rename the sync_list file.
Changes to config or sync_list Usage:
If you change sync_dir in your config.
If you start using sync_list (i.e., create the file when it wasn't there before).
If you stop using sync_list (i.e., delete or rename the file).
You MUST run /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --resync again. This tells the client to rebuild its understanding based on the new rules.
Minor changes inside sync_list (adding/removing a file path) usually don't require a full --resync; a simple --sync should pick up the changes.
