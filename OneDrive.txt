Command to use: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --download-only
My OneDrive Client Setup on Linux (using abraunegg/onedrive)
1. What You've Done (The Setup Process):
Installed the Client: You've installed the onedrive client for Linux, specifically the one developed by abraunegg (from GitHub: https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive). This is a powerful and well-maintained command-line client.
Initial Authorization: You would have run onedrive once without arguments (or with --resync for the very first time) and followed a link to authorize the application with your Microsoft account, then pasted the response URI back into the terminal.
Configured the Client:
You created/edited the main configuration file: /home/david/.config/onedrive/config
In this file, you've set:
sync_dir = "/home/david/Documents": This tells the client that your local OneDrive folder (where files will be downloaded to and uploaded from) is /home/david/Documents.
monitor_interval = "300": This means if you use the --monitor mode, the client will check for changes every 300 seconds (5 minutes).
You created a selective sync file: /home/david/.config/onedrive/sync_list
In this file, you've listed KpopDatabase_2.1.xlsm. This tells the client:
Only download/sync this specific file (and any folders needed to reach it if it's nested on OneDrive).
If other files/folders exist in your /home/david/Documents directory that were previously synced from OneDrive but are not in sync_list, they will be deleted locally during a resync or normal sync to make the local directory match the sync_list criteria. They remain on OneDrive.
Performed an Initial Resynchronization: You just successfully ran /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --resync (or --synchronize --resync). This was crucial because:
It told the client to discard any old ideas it had about your synced files.
It forced it to re-read your config and sync_list.
It then scanned your entire OneDrive online, compared it to your sync_list, and built a fresh local "map" of what needs to be synced, downloading KpopDatabase_2.1.xlsm into /home/david/Documents.
2. How to Sync Your Files (Common Commands):
Remember to run these commands from your terminal. You can be in any directory when you run them, as the client knows where your sync_dir is from the config.
A. One-Time Sync (Recommended for most manual syncs):
Command: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync
What it does:
Checks for changes on OneDrive (for files in your sync_list).
Downloads any new or updated files from OneDrive to /home/david/Documents.
Checks for local changes in /home/david/Documents (for files in your sync_list).
Uploads any new or updated local files to OneDrive.
Deletes local files if they were removed from OneDrive (and were in sync_list).
Deletes remote files if they were deleted locally (and were in sync_list) unless you configure sync_dir_permissions or other flags to prevent this. (Default is two-way sync).
B. One-Time Sync (Download-Only):
Command: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --download-only
What it does:
Checks for changes on OneDrive (for files in your sync_list).
Downloads any new or updated files from OneDrive to /home/david/Documents.
It will NOT upload any local changes you've made. This is useful if you only want to fetch from the cloud.
C. Continuous Sync (Monitor Mode - "Set it and Forget it"):
Command: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --monitor
What it does:
The client starts and performs an initial sync (like --sync).
It then runs in the background (or foreground, keeping your terminal busy unless you background it with & and nohup).
Every monitor_interval seconds (300 seconds / 5 minutes for you), it automatically checks for changes and syncs them (both downloads and uploads, according to your sync_list).
To stop it: If it's running in the foreground, press Ctrl+C in the terminal. If you backgrounded it, you'd need to find its process ID (ps aux | grep onedrive) and use kill <PID>.
3. Important Reminders & Troubleshooting:
sync_list is Key: If you're using sync_list, only the items in that file will be present in your /home/david/Documents directory after a sync. If you want to sync more items, add them to the sync_list file (one item per line). If you want to sync everything, delete or rename the sync_list file.
Changes to config or sync_list Usage:
If you change sync_dir in your config.
If you start using sync_list (i.e., create the file when it wasn't there before).
If you stop using sync_list (i.e., delete or rename the file).
You MUST run /usr/local/bin/onedrive --sync --resync again. This tells the client to rebuild its understanding based on the new rules.
Minor changes inside sync_list (adding/removing a file path) usually don't require a full --resync; a simple --sync should pick up the changes.
File Locked Error (HTTP 423):
As you saw, this means the file is locked on OneDrive's servers, usually because it's open in an application (like Excel) on another computer or in your web browser (Excel Online).
Solution: Close the file everywhere else, wait a few minutes, then try syncing again.
Configuration Files Location: /home/david/.config/onedrive/ (this is where config and sync_list live).
Getting Help: /usr/local/bin/onedrive --help will show you all available commands and options.
