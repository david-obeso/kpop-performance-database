For **refreshing the artist list from Spotify** (i.e., updating the list of artists in your main database), it should be called the script that **imports or updates the artist list itself**.

- spotify_album_importer.py  
  - **Purpose:** Imports albums and their associated artists from your Spotify library.  
  - **Effect:** Adds new artists (and albums) to your main database.

- spotify_artist_info_importer.py  
  - **Purpose:** Enriches existing artists in your database with additional info (images, popularity, followers, etc).  
  - **Effect:** Updates details for artists that are already present.
